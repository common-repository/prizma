Prizma for WordPress curates both content from throughout the Prizma Syndication Network—a hand-curated group of sites that produce quality, brand-aligned content—your own video inventory, or both, ensuring the right content is showed to the right person at the right time. You can specify what types of content belong on your site (but our recommendation engine is best-in-class, we swear!).

Nope! Well, not other than the fact that the Prizma for WordPress plugin is adding a bunch of curated video content to it. Prizma is designed to be a beautiful plug-and-play experience. Of course, you can also fully control the experience using your own CSS.
